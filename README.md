# moodle-filter_signature
Adds a Filter to Moodle that allows a signature-field to be placed in any context.

Every user with the capability "filter/signature:sign" can sign in
that field (default for any authenticated user).

Users with the capability "filter/signature:list" can view the list of
all signatures.

Users with the capability "filter/signature:manage" can remove signatures
from the list.
